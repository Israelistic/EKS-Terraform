# rollout
# Let’s create a simple deployment using nginx, as we do so we’ll tee the yaml to a file and we’ll apply it, at the same time, we’re going to revisit this yaml later:
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml | tee nginx-deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -


# If we query deployments, we will see our nginx deployment -
kubectl get deployment

# We will now have a replicaSet, with a unique identifier, note the name of the identifier, make a reference to this for comparison later on -
kubectl get replicaset

# If we query our pods, these will be named with the name of the deployment, replicaSet and a unique identifier -
kubectl get pods -o wide

# Deployments have a history, lets check the initial rollout history -
kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx
kubectl rollout status deployment


#annotate
# At the moment there is only 1 section in our history, we can annote this to make use of this record -
kubectl annotate deployment/nginx kubernetes.io/change-cause="initial deployment"


#And if we check again, we can see our annotation -
kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx


# Currently our deployment has a single replica and it's using the nginx image, verify this using get deployment -
kubectl get deployment -o wide


# Let's scale the number of replicas, we will run a watch command straight after to see this as it progresses, press ctrl-c to exit -
kubectl scale deployment/nginx --replicas=10; watch kubectl get pods -o wide

# Checking our deployment again will show 10/10 replicas
kubectl get deployment -o wide

#Modify the nginx-deployment.yaml file so that it is using 12 replicas, for example -
