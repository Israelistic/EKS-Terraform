### Pause Deployment and Two Changes

# Pause the Deployment
kubectl rollout pause deployment/<Deployment-Name>
kubectl rollout pause deployment/my-nginx

# Update Deployment - Application Version from V3 to V4
kubectl set image deployment/my-nginx nginx=nginx --record=true

# Check the Rollout History of a Deployment
kubectl rollout history deployment/my-nginx  
Observation: No new rollout should start, we should see same number of versions as we check earlier with last version number matches which we have noted earlier.

# Get list of ReplicaSets
kubectl get rs
Observation: No new replicaSet created. We should have same number of replicaSets as earlier when we took note. 

# Make one more change: set limits to our container
kubectl set resources deployment/my-nginx -c=kubenginx --limits=cpu=20m,memory=30Mi
